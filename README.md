Game of High or Low: Go (GoLang)
------------------------------------------------

This game was created to practice my go skills.

1. The game generates a full deck of cards, which the dealer shuffles when the game starts.
2. The shuffled deck is returned and a card is displayed to the user.
3. The user must specify is the next card will be higher or lower
4. The game will determine the success of the users choice and will call the implemented dealCard function on the deck type.
5. If the user is successful, the game will continue to the next round and will keep running until the deck has 2 cards left.
6. If the user is unsuccessful at any round, the dealer will stop the game
